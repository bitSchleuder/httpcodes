## [405 Method Not Allowed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/405)
The request method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used. For example, an API may forbid DELETE-ing a resource. The two mandatory methods, GET and HEAD, must never be disabled and should not return this error code.
